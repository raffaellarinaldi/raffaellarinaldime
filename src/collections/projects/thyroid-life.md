Originally conceived as a magazine, this project evolved to a personal blog chronicling my experience with hyperthyroidism for more streamlined management. The content, currently available only in Italian, is self-produced and will soon be distributed also on Instagram. The editorial calendar, informed by market analysis of trending keywords, is fully self-managed and partly supported by affiliate marketing. At its peak, the project garnered around 7K monthly unique visits. Presently, it's undergoing a relaunch, incorporating video versions of articles generated with AI using royalty-free media as a foundation. An unparalleled journey in digital marketing and personal discovery, indeed.
