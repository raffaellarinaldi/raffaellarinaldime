An entirely static artistic portfolio website, initially crafted with Jekyll and now powered by Eleventy. This project, which spans multiple languages and domains, is managed within a unified repository. Experimental workflows, meticulously researched and seamlessly integrated, contributed to a creatively challenging and original development process. The frontend, custom-tailored to the client's specifications, is constructed from the ground up using Liquid, UIKit, Gulp, and SASS. The deployment workflow effortlessly includes automatic FTP upload to the hosting server. Additionally, the site is SEO-optimized, boasting a dual sitemap catering to both pages and images.
