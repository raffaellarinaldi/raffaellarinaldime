A presentation website was developed for a B2B mold design and production workshop. After analyzing the client's needs, which were not particularly complex, the choice was made to use Bootstrap as the development platform. The resulting one-page site includes a corporate presentation, product photos, and contact information. The development drew inspiration from a site provided by the client, creating and integrating a brand image with specific colors and fonts. In addition to the website, consultation was provided for the Google My Business profile, addressing both geographic SEO requirements and the integration of a map on the new site.
