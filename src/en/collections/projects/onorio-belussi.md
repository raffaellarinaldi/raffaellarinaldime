The website was initially WordPress-based and later transitioned to Bearblog, a fast, minimalistic, privacy-focused blogging platform. Bearblog was chosen to provide the client, an agronomic communicator, with a lighter and simpler solution, which was well-received. The optimized site service includes the implementation of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, Linktree, and Raindrop profiles equally optimized for sharing updates and content curation, along with a VOXmail-based newsletter. Blog posts, authored by the client, undergo correction for enhanced search engine positioning. Additionally, an email forwarder was established through Cloudflare, ensuring the client receives emails without disclosing their private address.
