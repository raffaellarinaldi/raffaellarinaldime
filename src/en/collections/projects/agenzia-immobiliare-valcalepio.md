This Eleventy-powered hybrid single-page presentation site is tailored for a real estate agency. It features a highly functional web crawler created with Eleventy Fetch/Serverless and Netlify Functions, ensuring real-time listing updates from another domain without site redeployment. The frontend boasts a Bootstrap foundation, enhanced with a third-party theme meticulously modified and converted to 11ty, complemented by the sophistication of SASS and Gulp. An active GitHub Action orchestrates an automatic regeneration every 24 hours, showcasing the site's commitment to seamless and dynamic user experiences. Beyond its technical finesse, the site is meticulously SEO-optimized. The comprehensive service extends to defining a bespoke brand kit, implementing Google My Business, and providing strategic social media consultancy for platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Whatsapp Business.
