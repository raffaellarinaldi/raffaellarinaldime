Revitalizing a local non-profit's digital presence involved transforming a defunct WordPress site into a streamlined Google Sites platform. This strategic migration, seamlessly integrating with Google's tools, resolved functionality issues and empowered volunteers with an intuitive interface. Central to the project was redefining the association's brand image through font and color choices, facilitating brand recognition. My role extended to providing comprehensive guidance for volunteers, including training on content updating and formulating a cohesive digital communication strategy. Integrating Google Drive and Google Maps optimized resource sharing and event visibility. The collaborative efforts revitalized the non-profit's digital presence, aligning its website with contemporary standards. Volunteers now autonomously manage the site, ensuring a sustained and impactful online presence within the local community.
